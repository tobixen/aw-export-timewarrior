## TODO: we need to make a aw-watcher-lid that can send events to activitywatch informing about lid openings and closures and suspend actions (It's even possible to make different versions of it: read from journal, execute a push script directly from the systemd-login config.  Should investigate if there are any ways to give the user permissions to those events.  Should expand it to investigate downtime when the laptop has just been booted), fix the aw-export-timewarrior to honor the lid openings and closures, and make some tests on it.  In general when the lid is closed the user should ALWAYS be considered afk, but exceptions should be made when the lid is closed (or opened) for a very short time.
